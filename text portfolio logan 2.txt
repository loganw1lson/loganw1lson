about__info-position
Social Media Manager & Lead Graphic Designer at Arbor Eyecare since July 2022. I have directed social media growth and management, emphasizing analytics, content strategy, and channel optimization for enhanced engagement. Additionally, I've developed image/video content across Instagram & Facebook, automated posting schedules with Hootsuite, and followed industry trends to maximize engagement and traffic. My achievements include a 210% increase in website traffic within the initial three months of social media management, along with a 271% increase in website sessions during the same period, indicating a higher frequency of repeated visits and sustained user interest. I also implemented a successful campaign at Arbor Eyecare, creating impactful traditional advertising materials and strategically running Facebook and Instagram ads, resulting in a remarkable 30% increase in optical sales for November 2023 compared to the previous year's campaign.

Graphic Designer Remote for Renaissance Periodization or rpstrength from February 2023 to July 2023. I collaborated on a series of 7 fitness Health & Fitness ebooks for Dr. Mike Israetel. I successfully published and advertised the fitness ebooks on the @rpstrength Instagram account with a substantial following of 650k+. I translated intricate fitness concepts into visually appealing and easily understandable designs, enhancing the accessibility of the content. Managing multiple projects concurrently, I demonstrated strong organizational skills and the ability to meet deadlines with precision. I organized and managed files for ease of use across the Adobe Creative Suite according to brand guidelines.

Freelance Graphic Design since 2014 to Present. I have been working with over 50 clients and businesses, showcasing adaptability and versatility in design. I established a freelance career in 2014 by initially selling digital paintings of Minecraft skins, demonstrating entrepreneurial spirit and early recognition of market trends. Acquiring expertise in advertising and marketing, I leveraged platforms such as Twitter & YouTube to promote personal branding and services.
